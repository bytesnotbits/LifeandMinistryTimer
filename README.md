## 1. Overall Code Reliability and Efficiency Improvements
Modular Structure

Reorganized the code into logical modules with clear responsibilities (DOM cache, state management, rendering, utilities, etc.)
Reduced global state by encapsulating application state in a dedicated object
Improved separation of concerns between data handling, UI rendering, and event management

Performance Optimizations

Implemented efficient DOM updates by comparing content before updating
Added throttling and debouncing for frequent operations
Reduced unnecessary reflows by batching DOM updates
Memoized calculations for progress information to avoid redundant processing
Improved local storage operations with error handling and reduced writes

Error Handling

Added comprehensive error catching for all critical operations
Implemented recovery mechanisms for failed operations
Added validation for user inputs and data from local storage
Created user-friendly error notifications instead of console errors
Added protection against null/undefined values to prevent crashes

Accessibility Improvements

Enhanced keyboard navigation with improved focus states
Added descriptive ARIA attributes for screen readers
Improved semantic HTML structure with proper labels and roles
Added confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
Made focus visible for keyboard users
Improved color contrast for better readability

Code Maintainability

Added detailed comments explaining complex operations
Used consistent naming conventions throughout the codebase
Eliminated code duplication by creating reusable functions
Improved variable scoping to prevent leaks and conflicts
Added defensive programming practices to handle edge cases

## 2. New Features Implementation
### 1. Manually Adjust Comment Timer
Implemented the ability to adjust active comment timers with +5/-5 second buttons:
javascript
```
function incrementCommentTimer() {
    state.adjustCommentTimer(5);
}

function decrementCommentTimer() {
    state.adjustCommentTimer(-5);
}
```
The comment adjustment controls only appear when a comment is active, and they specifically modify the start time of the comment rather than the part timer. This ensures that only the comment duration is affected without altering the overall part timer.

### 2. Reset Specific Meeting Part Timer
Added a "Reset" button for each part that allows users to reset just that timer:
javascript
```
function resetPartTimer(partIndex) {
    if (state.isRunning && state.activePart === partIndex) {
        DOM.showConfirmation(
            'Reset Timer',
            'This will reset the timer for the current part. Continue?',
            () => state.resetTimer(partIndex)
        );
    } else {
        state.resetTimer(partIndex);
        render.timerDisplay();
    }
}
```
The implementation includes a confirmation dialog when resetting an active timer, and properly handles the UI update after reset.

### 3. Remove Existing Comments
Added the ability to delete individual comments from the comment history:
javascript
```
function deleteComment(commentId) {
    DOM.showConfirmation(
        'Delete Comment',
        'Are you sure you want to delete this comment?',
        () => state.deleteComment(commentId)
    );
}
```
Each comment now has a unique ID, and when deleted, the average timer and comment count are automatically recalculated. The UI updates to reflect these changes instantly.

### 4. Confirm Page Refresh with Active Timer
Implemented a confirmation dialog when users attempt to leave or refresh the page while a timer is running:
javascript
```
window.addEventListener('beforeunload', (e) => {
    if (state.isRunning) {
        e.preventDefault();
        e.returnValue = 'You have a timer running. Are you sure you want to leave?';
        return e.returnValue;
    }
});
```
This uses the standard browser confirmation when leaving a page with unsaved changes.

### 5. Save/Load Multiple User-Defined Templates
Implemented a complete template management system with a modal interface:
javascript
```
const templateManager = {
    getTemplates() {
        try {
            const templates = localStorage.getItem('savedTemplates');
            return templates ? JSON.parse(templates) : {};
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Error loading templates:', error);
            return {};
        }
    },
    
    saveTemplate(name) {
        try {
            const templates = this.getTemplates();
            templates[name] = state.meetingParts;
            localStorage.setItem('savedTemplates', JSON.stringify(templates));
            notify.show(`Template "${name}" saved successfully`, 'success');
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Error saving template:', error);
            notify.show('Failed to save template', 'error');
        }
    },
    
    // Additional methods for loading, deleting, and rendering templates
    // ...
}
```
Users can now save the current template with a custom name, load any previously saved template, and delete templates they no longer need.

## 3. Additional Improvements
Notification System
Added a toast notification system that provides users with feedback after important actions:
javascript
```
const notify = {
    show(message, type = 'info', duration = 3000) {
        // Implementation details
    }
};
```
This gives users visual confirmation of actions like saving templates, deleting comments, etc.
Responsive Design Enhancements

Improved mobile layout with flex-wrapping controls
Added responsive grid for template form
Enhanced touch targets for mobile users
Improved spacing and layout for different screen sizes

Visual Improvements

Consistent styling with CSS custom properties
Smoother animations for UI interactions
Enhanced progress bar with better color transitions
Improved focus states for interactive elements
Fade-in animations for newly added items

Browser Compatibility

Added cross-browser vendor prefixes for CSS
Used standard ES6+ features with broad browser support
Added fallbacks for newer JavaScript features
Implemented standardized event handling compatible with all modern browsers

Summary
This significant update transforms the Life and Ministry Timer from a basic utility into a robust, user-friendly application. The improvements focus on three main areas:

Code Quality: Better organization, error handling, and performance optimizations make the code more maintainable and reliable.
User Experience: New features like template management, comment controls, and timer adjustments make the app more useful and adaptable to different meeting scenarios.
Technical Foundation: The new architecture provides a solid foundation for future features like meeting reports and real-time sharing capabilities.

All changes were implemented while maintaining backward compatibility with existing data stored in localStorage, ensuring a smooth transition for current users.
