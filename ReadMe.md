## Successfully fixed the edit mode toggle button to provide visual feedback when toggled. Here's what was implemented:
- Visual Feedback for Toggle Button: Modified the toggleEditMode function to explicitly update the toggle's appearance by adding/removing the appropriate CSS classes when the state changes.
- Persistence Across Page Refreshes: Added code to save the edit mode state to localStorage and load it when the page is refreshed, ensuring the toggle state persists.
- Proper Initialization: Updated the state's init function to correctly set the toggle's appearance based on the loaded state when the page loads.
- UI Synchronization: Enhanced the render.init function to properly initialize the edit mode UI elements based on the current state.
- Reset Functionality: Updated the clearAllData function to also clear the edit mode state when resetting all data.

These changes ensure that the edit mode toggle now provides clear visual feedback when toggled on/off, and the state is properly maintained across page refreshes. The toggle now turns blue when edit mode is active and reverts to gray when inactive.
