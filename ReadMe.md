## Successfully implemented the part template editor with drag and drop functionality.

### Added edit mode functions to the state object in lifeMinistryTimer.js:
toggleEditMode() - Toggles edit mode on/off
editPart() - Opens the part editor modal for a specific part
savePartEdits() - Saves changes made in the part editor modal
cancelPartEdits() - Cancels editing and closes the modal
addPartAt() - Adds a new part at a specific position
addPart() - Adds a new part at the end
removePart() - Removes a part with confirmation
startDrag() - Starts dragging a part
endDrag() - Ends dragging a part
movePart() - Moves a part from one position to another
Updated the DOM cache to include the new UI elements for edit mode.

### Added event listeners for the edit mode toggle and part editor modal buttons.

### Added the keyboard shortcut 'E' for toggling edit mode.

### Updated the render.js file to modify the timerDisplay function to:
Add drag and drop attributes to the part cards when in edit mode
Add edit controls to the part cards when in edit mode
Add buttons to insert parts before/after existing parts
Add a button to remove a part
Add drop zones between parts for drag and drop functionality

### Added CSS styles for:
Edit mode toggle and controls
Part cards in edit mode
Drop zones
Dragging state
Part editor modal
Updated the shortcuts modal to include the edit mode shortcut.

The implementation completely removes the Meeting Template section and replaces it with the ability to edit the meeting cards themselves. Users can now:

Toggle edit mode on/off using the toggle switch or 'E' key
Drag and drop parts to reorder them
Add new parts before or after existing parts
Edit part details (name, speaker, duration, comments)
Remove parts
